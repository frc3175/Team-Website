Mrs. Galea<br /><br />Hello all,
I hope you have all had the chance to get adjusted to being back to school. We are looking forward to a great FTC season and are excited to be working with all of you. Please see the information below regarding practice dates and times, and competition season notes.
 
In order for our practice times to run smoothly and efficiently, please make sure you look over the game manual/rules prior to our Friday practice time. This will help make more informed decisions on the design and focus of the robots this year.
 
We currently have 23 students who have indicated an interest in the program (yeah!). If you are receiving this e-mail and are not going to be participating in FTC this season, please let me know asap so I can remove you from our mailing list and we can be sure to register the proper number of teams. Our plan at this point is to have two teams; one girls (11) team and one boys team (12). If the numbers get any larger or we get consistently high participation at practices, we very well may register our third team. While the maximum size for a team is 15, I prefer to stick around 10 to give everyone the most opportunity to get involved.
 
After sitting down with Mr. Provenzano, we have come up with the following practice schedule which will start this week:
 
Girls team (Atomic Bombs 10545)
Mondays/Wednesdays during study hall at the end of the school day – meet in the MS tech room/maker space with Mr. Provenzano                                                                                                                                

Boys team (2Liggett 2Quit 7140)
Tuesdays/Thursdays during study hall at the end of the school day – meet in the MS tech room/maker space with Mr. Provenzano
 
Both teams:
Fridays from 3:30 – 5:30 in the tech room/maker space
Saturdays 12:30 – 4:30 in the tech room/maker space
 
While we would love to have everyone there for the entirety of each practice, we understand there will be conflicts. These are the hours that the faculty coaches/mentors are available to assist the teams. Any parents who are interested in helping the teams succeed in any way (technical and non-technical opportunities are available) please let me know.
 
We are asking that parents volunteer to provide snacks for these practices and we will not plan to have full meals due to the times each practice will be held. You can sign up to bring a snack here.
 
We will start with disassembling last year’s robots and brainstorming design ideas this week. In addition, Tony Pan (our Upper school team member who is mentoring the FTC program) has put together some programming classes/tutorials that he will share with the kids on Fridays.
 
Faculty schedule (Subject to change):
September 22/23 – Kim Galea
September 29/30 – Nick Provenzano
October 6/7 – Scott Brunner
October 13/14 – Nick Provenzano
October 20/21 – Kim Galea
October 27/28 – Scott Brunner
November 4th – Build wrap-up/possible start of competition season
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.<br /><br />09/17/17<hr /><br />Mrs. Galea<br /><br />Hello all!

I hope you have all had a great start to the school year and are looking forward to an exciting year of robotics. I am super excited to work with all of you this year and see what opportunities await with all of the changes that have happened over the past year. 

First off, I would like to welcome Nick Provenzano and Scott Brunner to our team of mentors/faculty who will be helping the middle school teams succeed this year. Both teachers bring a wealth of knowledge and will help make the program better than ever. We are also expecting to add additional parent mentors (Barbara Yoshida and Kaevon Hunter) and at least one additional upper school team member (Blake) to our list of supporters/mentors. Finally, welcome back to Dan Sikora, Tony Pan, (and Anthony Galea via Skype when available) who will continue with mentoring this season. 

Our current numbers are indicating that we will need at least two teams and we can add the third team if numbers merit it. The season kicks off this coming Saturday and we are hoping to have as many of you join us at the kickoff event as possible. We have reserved a bus to take us to the kickoff event which will be held at Bloomfield Hills High School (Bloomfield Hills High School located at 4200 Andover Rd, Bloomfield Hills MI 48302) this year (this was at Kettering last year for those of you who were a part of the team). Please see the attached flyer for the event agenda/schedule. 

The bus is scheduled to leave at 7:15am and return to Liggett around 2:15pm. Please send a bag lunch with your student if they plan to attend – alternatively, concessions will be available (coffee, water, bagels, doughnuts, fresh fruit and other snack items). Please be sure to RSVP to this e-mail if you/your child plan to attend. 

If you know of other students who are interested in participating in robotics this year, please feel free to forward this information to them and have them contact myself or Nick Provenzano to let us know of their interest. 

The practice schedule is still TBD, but some thoughts include having students work on robotics during their study hall at the end of each day, Friday practices (no sports practices), and/or Saturday practices in order to allow students the ability to continue participating in their selected sports as well as robotics. Once we solidify the team rosters, practice schedules will be determined that will accommodate those involved to the best of our ability.

In addition to the kickoff event on Saturday, the robotics program (elementary through high school) will be hosting a demo booth at the back to school picnic on Sunday from 4-6pm. If any of  you would be interested in assisting at the booth (demonstrating NXT robotics, FLL from last year, or just talking with guests about your robotics experience), please let me know. I have asked upper school robotics team members to volunteer for shifts (3pm – 5pm set up or 5pm – 7pm tear down). Hopefully some of you will be able to join us in spreading the word about this fun program. 

Please remember to RSVP regarding your attendance to the kickoff event AND/OR the picnic if you are able to attend. I will be on retreat with the ninth graders, but will be able to check my e-mail occasionally. If you need immediate assistance, please feel free to text me at 734-558-9737. As long as cell reception remains good, I should be able to reply more promptly via text. 

I look forward to hearing back from many of you and seeing you on Saturday morning bright and early!
<br /><br />9/5/17<hr /><br />﻿<br />﻿Mrs. Galea<br /><br />Hello all!
 
I hope you have all had a great summer break, and are looking forward to a great year of robotics. Even though it is not yet our official season, we already have a few upcoming events to attend to. Please be sure to communicate your availability to all scheduled events to me ASAP so I can ensure we have the adequate coverage to make the events successful.
 
As a reminder, there will be some changes to the requirements for earning season credit this year. One of those changes will be a requirement for participation in our outreach and other off-season events (blood drive, library events, picnic, Barnes and Noble, Kettering Kickoff, mentoring FTC/FLL etc.). There will be several opportunities to earn these hours, but you should seriously consider helping sooner rather than later if you are available.
 
In order to make these events successful, we will also need to gather to finish cleaning up the practice space as well as make some repairs to the robot (replace the belt that feeds the shooter, others?). I will be at the school August 29 – 31 for meetings if any of you have the chance to stop by and work on these tasks, please let me know.
 
Upcoming Events:
September 10
Back to school picnic/BBQ
Liggett grounds
4pm – 6pm
We will be hosting a booth where we will have some LEGO robots built for kids to play with, have some kits that kids can build LEGO robots, demo our 2017 FRC robot (hopefully), and any other activities you may think would be cool (PLEASE let me know if you have ideas). We will need at least 5-6 team members to help at the booth and can do two shifts if needed (3:00 – 5:00 set-up and first shift, and 5:00 – 6:30 second shift and clean-up). Please reply to let me know when you can help out.
 
September 16
Kettering Kick-off
Kettering University
Exact times TBA – this will be an all-day event similar to our competitions so approximately 8am – 8pm (at Ketteirng – departure from Liggett around 6:30am) with the option to set up and participate in practice matches on September 15 after school.
This is a great opportunity for students interested in being considered for the 2018 drive team to practice in a competition setting. We need a minimum of 5 students to participate! Please let me know if you can participate.
 
Additional activities:
FTC Kickoff happens September 9th
We will have a minimum of two FTC teams this season. They find out what their challenge will be this season on September 9th. Specific plans will be determined next week once I get the chance to meet with the new FTC coordinator. Please let me know which days/times you might be available to help mentor these teams. If you earn enough hours mentoring an FTC team, you may have the ability to earn season credit.
 
The FLL game (Hydro Dynamics) has already been released and the two (minimum) FLL teams will begin meeting shortly after school starts to begin working on their robots. Please let me know which days/times you might be available to help mentor these teams. If you earn enough hours mentoring an FLL team, you may have the ability to earn season credit.<br /><br />08/24/2017<br /><br />

# Team-Website

This is the website for the University Liggett School robotics team.

To use this yourself, there is only one change you MUST make before deploying
to production. In `admin.php`, put your password in the double quotes after
the `==` operator. **NEVER** upload this file to a publicly accessible place,
such as a GitHub repository, without removing your password first.

#### TODO
- Try making only one main page that just loads a different PHP file in the main
content area based on what menu item is clicked
